<h2>üëã Hello there!</h2>
<p>I'm Tiago Prestes, a Brazilian tech enthusiast and a passionate software developer. I am currently an Information Systems student in Pontif√≠cia Universidade Cat√≥lica do Paran√°.
<br>I enjoy the thrill of learning new things and being actively involved in problem-solving scenarios. <br>If you have any questions or would like to discuss potential collaborations, I'd be more than happy to connect!</p>

<h2>üìö Skills</h2>
<p>My primary focus is on front-end development, where I pursue to build interactive and user-friendly web applications. I have intermediate knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and I am currently learning React to strengthen my skill set.
<br>However, my goal is to become a Full Stack developer someday, and to achieve this, I'm also looking trough some Back-End technologies.</p>
