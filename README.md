<h2>👋 Hello there!</h2>
<p>I'm Tiago, a Brazilian tech enthusiast and a passionate software developer. I am currently an Information Systems student in Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Paraná.
<br>I enjoy the thrill of learning new things and being actively involved in problem-solving scenarios. <br>If you have any questions or would like to discuss potential collaborations, I'd be more than happy to connect!</p>

<h2>📚 Skills</h2>
I like to mainly practice languages such as JavaScript and Java, although I do some coding on PHP and Python occasionally. I am currently learning some new technologies (like React, Angular and Node.js) to strengthen my skill set as a developer.
